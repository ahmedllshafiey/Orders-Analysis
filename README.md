# Orders Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer orders to extract meaningful insights, such as trends in order data, unique countries involved in transactions, and total amounts by various categories. The analysis is performed using Python and data manipulation libraries.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Ensures proper formatting of dates and handles missing or duplicate data.
- **Resampling**: Aggregates data by month-end to analyze trends over time.
- **Visualization**: Generates bar and pie charts for better understanding of data distributions.
- **Top 10 Analysis**: Focuses on the top 10 categories (e.g., countries) for detailed insights.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identifies relationships between numerical variables.
- **Top Countries Analysis**: Highlights the top-performing countries by total order amount.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- **`Orders.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis and visualization.
- **`Database/all_data.csv`**: The dataset used for analysis, containing customer and order details.

## Requirements

The project uses the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `plotly`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

To install the required libraries, run:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy plotly matplotlib seaborn
```

## Future Work

- Incorporate machine learning models to predict order trends.
- Add customer segmentation analysis to identify key customer groups.
- Automate the generation of reports for stakeholders.
