# Orders Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing customer orders to extract meaningful insights, such as trends in order data, unique countries involved in transactions, and total amounts by various categories. The analysis is performed using Python and data manipulation libraries.

## Project Overview

The project includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Aggregation and resampling of data for time-based analysis.
- Visualization of trends and proportions using `plotly` and `matplotlib`.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Ensures proper formatting of dates and handles missing or duplicate data.
- **Resampling**: Aggregates data by month-end to analyze trends over time.
- **Visualization**: Generates bar and pie charts for better understanding of data distributions.
- **Top 10 Analysis**: Focuses on the top 10 categories (e.g., countries) for detailed insights.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:
- **`Orders.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis and visualization.
- **`Database/all_data.csv`**: The dataset used for analysis, containing customer and order details.

## Requirements

The project uses the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `plotly`
- `matplotlib`

To install the required libraries, run:
```bash
